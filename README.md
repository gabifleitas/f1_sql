# f1_sql

As part of Unicorn Academy's Data Analysis Bootcamp, this project proposes a comprehensive analysis of a relational model representing historical Formula 1 data to generate strategic responses for Liberty Media Corporation (LMC) management.

LMC has requested our support as data analysts to prepare reports explaining trends in driver, team, and race performance over the years. The questions posed seek to support decision-making at their annual meeting.

The database used includes detailed information on seasons, race results, pit stops, rankings, times, positions, accumulated points, and geographical characteristics of each circuit. This relational structure allows for medium- and high-complexity SQL queries to generate in-depth descriptive analyses.

The overall objective of the project is to translate business questions into well-structured SQL queries and produce clear and useful answers for management, based on a rigorous analysis of historical data. Through this process, skills in relational modelling, data exploration, and analytical thinking are strengthened.
